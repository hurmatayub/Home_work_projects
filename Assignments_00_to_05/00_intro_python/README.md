🌟 Python Home Work Assignments by Hurmat Muhammad Ayub
Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly Python mini projects! 💻✨
These projects are built using Google Colab and are designed to practice the basics of Python including user input, functions, arithmetic operations, and logic-building.

🔍 Project Descriptions
📌 01. Add Two Numbers
Takes two integers from the user and prints their sum using basic arithmetic and input conversion.

📌 02. Favorite Animal Echo
Asks the user their favorite animal and responds with:
"My favorite animal is also ___!"
(Using user input in a sentence.)

📌 03. Favorite Animal (Using Function)
Same as above, but wrapped inside a function called favorite_animal() to show how reusable functions work.

📌 04. Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter
Takes input in Fahrenheit, converts it to Celsius using the formula:
C = (F - 32) * 5.0/9.0
Written inside a function fahrenheit_to_celsius() for clean and reusable logic.

📌 05. Age Riddle Solver
A fun riddle where we calculate the ages of 5 people (Anton, Beth, Chen, Drew, Ethan) using math logic and store the values in variables.

📌 06. Age Riddle (Using Function)
The same riddle wrapped inside a function solve_age_riddle() to demonstrate logic inside reusable blocks.

📌 07. Triangle Perimeter Calculator
Takes 3 side lengths from the user (float) and calculates the perimeter using:
perimeter = side1 + side2 + side3
All wrapped inside a neat function.

📌 08. Square a Number
Takes a number from the user and prints its square using simple multiplication:
square = number * number
Function: square_number()

💡 Purpose of Using def (Functions)
In some projects, I’ve used functions to:

Organize the code better
Make the logic reusable
Improve readability
Separate logic from execution
Each function is designed to do one specific task, which helps make the program easier to understand and expand later.
