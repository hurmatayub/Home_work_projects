# 🌟 Python Home Work Assignments by Hurmat Muhammad Ayub

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly **Python mini projects**! 💻✨  
These projects are built using **Google Colab** and are designed to practice the basics of Python including user input, functions, arithmetic operations, and logic-building.

## 🔍 Project Descriptions

### 📌 01. Add Two Numbers
Takes two integers from the user and prints their sum using basic arithmetic and input conversion.

### 📌 02. Favorite Animal Echo
Asks the user their favorite animal and responds with:  
`"My favorite animal is also ___!"`  
(Using user input in a sentence.)

### 📌 03. Favorite Animal (Using Function)
Same as above, but wrapped inside a function called `favorite_animal()` to show how reusable functions work.

### 📌 04. Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter
Takes input in Fahrenheit, converts it to Celsius using the formula:  
`C = (F - 32) * 5.0/9.0`  
Written inside a function `fahrenheit_to_celsius()` for clean and reusable logic.

### 📌 05. Age Riddle Solver
A fun riddle where we calculate the ages of 5 people (Anton, Beth, Chen, Drew, Ethan) using math logic and store the values in variables.

### 📌 06. Age Riddle (Using Function)
The same riddle wrapped inside a function `solve_age_riddle()` to demonstrate logic inside reusable blocks.

### 📌 07. Triangle Perimeter Calculator
Takes 3 side lengths from the user (float) and calculates the perimeter using:  
`perimeter = side1 + side2 + side3`  
All wrapped inside a neat function.

### 📌 08. Square a Number
Takes a number from the user and prints its square using simple multiplication:  
`square = number * number`  
Function: `square_number()`

## 💡 Purpose of Using `def` (Functions)

In some projects, I’ve used **functions** to:
- **Organize** the code better
- Make the logic **reusable**
- Improve **readability**
- Separate **logic** from **execution**

Each function is designed to do **one specific task**, which helps make the program easier to understand and expand later.
